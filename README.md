Anki cards for [the fast.ai v4 part 1 course](https://course.fast.ai/)

Import cards using default import settings. Many cards utilize images - they should render assuming you have internet access.

Each card has a link to [aiquizzes](https://aiquizzes.com) at the bottom (there might be additional information available on `aiquizzes`, such as reference to the part of the lecture that discusses a given concept). Nonetheless, the information in the anki cards should be sufficient for review without accessing external resources.
